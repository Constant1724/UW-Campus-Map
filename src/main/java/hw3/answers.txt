Problem 1. (Written exercises)

(a)
    IntQueue1:
        Abstraction function:
            IntQueue1, q, holds a queue of elements, maintains the order of insertion in entries.
            Specifically, the i-th element in q.entries should be the i-th element to be returned.
            For example, q.entries.get(0) should be the first to be returned,
            and q.entries.get(1) should be the second to be returned.

        Representation Invariant:
            entries != null &&
            forall i such that (0 <= i < entries.size()): entries.get(i) != null
            In other words:
            entries should not be null and there should not be null elements inside the entries.

    IntQueue2:
        Abstraction function:
            IntQueue2, q, holds a queue of elements, maintains the order of insertion in entries.
            q.size indicates the total number of elements in the IntQueue2.
            q.front indicates the starting index of the current IntQueue2 in entries.
            Specifically, the i-th element should be q.entries.[(i + q.front) % q.entries.length], if i < q.size/

        Representation Invariant:
            entries != null &&
            0 <= size <= entries.length &&
            0 <= front < entries.length &&
            forall i such that (0 <= i < size): entries[(i + q.front) % q.entries.length] != null
