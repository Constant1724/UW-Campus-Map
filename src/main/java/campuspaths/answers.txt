1. How has the View and Controller been split in your code? Think about how React splits up the same.

2. What decisions did you make when you refactored your code to work with Spring?
    I did not refactor my previous code as doing that will affect backward compatibility.
    Instead, i make a service wrapper for CampusMapModel.

3. What decisions did you make when designing your API?
    First, i reason about what functionality does the web UI requires.
    It turns out the basic functionality is to get a list of available buildings
    and to find Path between any two buildings.
    As a result, my design only consists of theses two methods.

    Since the API accepts parameter from web request, which will be String, I decide to
    make the corresponding back-end method to take Strings as parameter.

4. What additional functionality did you add that you would like us to consider for Extra Credit?
