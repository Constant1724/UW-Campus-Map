Briefly describe any changes made to your Graph ADT from HW 3-4 and why
those changes were made below.  (See the HW6 assignment for details.)

The first change I made is to refactor the code. Specifically, I make Node and Edge as inner classes for graph, and
add a makeNode/makeEdge method to create a node or an edge. This is required by the HW6 spec, to achieve a single
top-level class.

The second change is that I change the getEdges method, so that it returns all out edges for a given node, instead
of return all edges in the graph. Because i realize that return all edges at once is less useful and less efficient,
and moreover, user can still access all edges in the graph by simply
iterate through the node and get edges for that node.
