# START_TEST
# NAME SelfChildren
# test if we can correctly listChildren for a Node in the graph.
# Create a graph
created graph graph1

# Add a pair of nodes
added node ValidNode1 to graph1

# Add an edge
added edge Edge1 from ValidNode1 to ValidNode1 in graph1

# Print outgoing edges from ValidNode1
the children of ValidNode1 in graph1 are: ValidNode1(Edge1)
