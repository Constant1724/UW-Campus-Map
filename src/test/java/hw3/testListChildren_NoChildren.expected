# START_TEST
# NAME NoChildren
# test if we can correctly listChildren for a Node in the graph.
# Create a graph
created graph graph1

# Add a pair of nodes
added node ValidNode1 to graph1
added node ValidNode2 to graph1
added node ValidNode3 to graph1

# Add an edge
added edge Edge1 from ValidNode1 to ValidNode2 in graph1
added edge Edge1 from ValidNode1 to ValidNode3 in graph1

# Print outgoing edges from ValidNode2 and ValidNode3
the children of ValidNode2 in graph1 are:
the children of ValidNode3 in graph1 are:
