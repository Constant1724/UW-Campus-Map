# START_TEST
# NAME AnotherSimpleTest
# test a graph can be loaded and correctly find the path from A to B, with least
# cost, as cost being the alphabetical ordering of edges and labels..

# Create a graph
created graph graph1

# AddNode
added node A to graph1
added node B to graph1
added node C to graph1
added node D to graph1

added edge 10.000 from A to B in graph1

added edge 1.000 from A to C in graph1

added edge 1.000 from C to D in graph1

added edge 1.000 from D to B in graph1

path from A to B:
A to C with weight 1.000
C to D with weight 1.000
D to B with weight 1.000
total cost: 3.000
